							<h2>Steps for Writing a Thesis</h2>
							<ul>
								<li>Topic: (What is the topic of your paragraph?)</li>
								<li>What you believe: (Students should be required to take coding classes)</li>
								<li>Plan of Development: (What are your 2 or 3 reasons?)</li>
							</ul>

							<h1>Example for Writing a Thesis</h1>
							<p>
								Students should be required to take coding classes because it helps them improve their
								problem-solving skills. Coding also encourages logical thinking, planning, and designing
								software programs. When students learn how to build websites or apps, they begin to
								think creatively in order to come up with strong, useful software. These skills don’t
								just help in class — they prepare students for real-life situations and future careers.
							</p>

							<h2>Steps for Writing an Essay</h2>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Understand the Prompt:</strong> Read the question or topic carefully. Make
									sure you know what the essay is asking you to do.</li>
								<li><strong>Brainstorm Ideas:</strong> Think of your main ideas. Write down key points,
									examples, and anything that supports your argument.</li>
								<li><strong>Make a Thesis Statement:</strong> This is the main point of your essay. It's
									usually one sentence that tells the reader what your essay is about.</li>
								<li><strong>Create an Outline:</strong> Plan the structure of your essay:
									<ul>
										<li>Introduction</li>
										<li>Body Paragraph 1</li>
										<li>Body Paragraph 2</li>

										<li>Start with a hook to grab attention</li>
										<li>Give some background</li>
										<li>End with your thesis statement</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
								<li><strong>Write the Conclusion:</strong>
									<ul>
										<li>Restate your thesis in a new way</li>
										<li>Summarize your main points</li>
										<li>End with a final thought or message</li>

							<h1 style="font-size: 1.5rem;"><strong>Why students need to learn coding </strong><br> </h1>
								In today’s world, technology is everywhere from smartphones and tablets to websites,
								apps, and video games. That’s why students should be required to take coding classes in
								school. Learning to code helps students become better problem solvers, think more
								logically, and express their creativity. It also teaches them important real-world
								skills that can help them succeed in school, future careers, and everyday life.
							</p>

							<p>
								<br>
								One of the biggest benefits of learning how to code is that it improves problem-solving
								skills. When students write code, they have to figure out how to fix bugs, break down
								large problems, and come up with step by step solutions. This kind of thinking doesn't
								just help them become better coders — it also makes them better at subjects like math,
								science, and even writing. Logical thinking helps students in every subject, and coding
								is one of the best ways to build that skill.
							</p>

							<p>
								<br>
								Coding also teaches students how to plan and stay organized. When they create a website
								or app, they need to decide how it will work, what the design will look like, and how
								people will use it. These decisions help build project planning and time management
								skills, which are useful in school and later in life. It also helps students learn how
								to work on long-term projects, which is something many jobs require.
							</p>

							<p>
								<br>
								Many people think coding is all about numbers, but it’s actually a very creative skill.
								Students get to design and build things that didn’t exist before — whether that’s a cool
								app, a fun game, or a helpful website. They use their imagination to solve real-world
								problems, and that creative thinking can lead to exciting innovations. Coding lets
								students turn ideas into real projects, and that’s a powerful feeling.

								In addition, coding can open up job opportunities in the future. Technology is one of
								the fastest-growing industries in the world, and many high-paying jobs today involve
								coding or other tech skills. By learning to code early, students can prepare themselves
								for these opportunities. Even if they don’t become professional programmers, the skills
								they learn — problem-solving, creativity, and planning — will still be super useful in
								many other careers.
							</p>
							<p>
								<br>
								It helps students develop important skills like problem-solving, logical thinking,
								creativity, and project planning. Coding also gives students the chance to prepare for a
								future filled with technology and innovation. The earlier students start learning how to
								code, the more confident and prepared they will be for high school, college, and the
								real world.

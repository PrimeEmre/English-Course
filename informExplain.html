                                One evening, a group of friends was sitting in a coffee shop, chatting about their
                                school lives. As one person shared a memory from his school days, another suddenly
                                punched him without any reason.

                                The man fell to the ground, shocked and confused, wondering why he was attacked. A few
                                minutes later, the police arrived and started investigating the scene. They asked
                                witnesses what happened and reviewed the coffee shop’s security footage.

                                It turned out the attacker had misunderstood something during the conversation and
                                reacted violently. Because he physically harmed someone without cause, he was arrested
                                and charged with harassment.

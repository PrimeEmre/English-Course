							<p>
								One day, I woke up in front of my computer. I didn’t even realize what time it was, so I
								kept working like a bee all night, trying to fix some bugs in my program. I had to stay
								up overnight because the bugs were incredibly annoying—like driving on a busy highway
								full of obstacles. They kept showing syntax errors while I was developing software
								related to operating systems. My goal was to help computers run faster and more
								smoothly, without crashing. That way, people wouldn’t need to worry about the software
								on their computers, because my operating system can fix those issues easily.
